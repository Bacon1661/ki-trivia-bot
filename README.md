# ki-trivia-bot
 Apologies, this project has been scrapped. Maybe I'll revisit it one day if there's reason to. 

 Script that automates the process of completing trivia on FreeKI Games to earn crowns in both Wizard101 and Pirate101.
 
 Still in its early stages, but works well enough thus far. If you have any issues with it (or it gets any questions incorrect), please report it. Feel free to contribute.
 
 Plans for the future include allowing you to use speedhacks with your browser to complete trivia faster and the bot opening the trivia page for you.
 
 Decided to make this due to no good existing solutions. Unlike other bots, it's 100% free, answers trivia for you, and can be used easily by using the compiled app found in releases (coming soon).
